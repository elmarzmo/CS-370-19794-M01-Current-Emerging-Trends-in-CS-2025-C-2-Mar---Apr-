What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists study and develop theories, algorithms, and systems that drive technology forward.
They solve complex problems and build software or hardware that impacts everyday life.
Their work matters because it shapes how we interact with the world and influences almost every industry today.


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and constraints, then breaking the problem down into smaller pieces. 
I research existing solutions, design possible approaches, test them, and iterate based on feedback or performance. 
 Problem-solving as a computer scientist involves logic, creativity, and continuous learning.

 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to create systems that are secure, accessible, and respectful of user privacy. 
I must ensure that the technology I develop does not cause harm and serves the best interest of users and the organization.
This includes writing ethical code, being transparent about data usage, and considering the long-term consequences of my designs.
