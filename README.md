Treasure Hunt Reinforcement Learning Project
## Overview

This project explores reinforcement learning by training an agent to navigate an 8×8 maze environment.
The agent receives rewards based on its actions and learns an optimal path using a neural-network-based Q-learning approach.

The model gradually improves by:

Exploring random moves

Evaluating rewards

Updating predictions to optimize future decisions

## Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features

Custom 8×8 "Treasure Hunt" maze environment

Q-learning reinforcement algorithm

Neural network policy for predicting optimal moves

Visual meter output showing progress

Simulation code that lets the agent navigate the maze after training
